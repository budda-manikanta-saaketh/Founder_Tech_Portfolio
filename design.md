# Foundr Tech Portfolio - Design Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
**Premium Editorial Aesthetic**: Inspired by high-end tech publications like Wired and The Verge, with a sophisticated, minimalist approach that immediately communicates expertise and premium positioning. The design balances bold visual impact with clean, professional presentation.

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep Charcoal (#1a1a1a) - Professional, sophisticated base
- **Secondary**: Warm White (#fafafa) - Clean, premium contrast
- **Accent**: Electric Blue (#0066ff) - Tech-forward, trustworthy highlight
- **Supporting**: Soft Gray (#6b7280) - Subtle text and UI elements

*Rationale*: This palette avoids typical startup colors while maintaining excellent contrast ratios (4.5:1+) for accessibility. The electric blue provides just enough color to guide attention without overwhelming the content.

### Typography
- **Display Font**: "Tiempos Headline" - Bold, editorial serif for impactful headings
- **Body Font**: "Suisse Int'l" - Clean, neutral sans-serif for readability
- **Code/Tech Font**: "JetBrains Mono" - For technical specifications and code snippets

*Hierarchy*: Large, bold headlines (48-72px) with smaller, refined body text (16-18px) for high-resolution elegance.
